abstract: "<div class=text-justify>Focusing on the representation of climate change in the British quality press, this article argues that the discursive (re)construction of scientific claims in the media is strongly entangled with ideological standpoints. Understood here as a set of ideas and values that legitimate a program of action vis-Ã -vis a given social and political order, ideology works as a powerful selection device in deciding what is scientific news, i.e. what the relevant facts are, and who are the authorized agents of definition of science matters. The representation of scientific knowledge has important implications for evaluating political programs and assessing the responsibility of both governments and the public in addressing climate change.</div>"
