abstract: "<div class=text-justify>This paper is written alongside and in conjunction with two other papers presented at the ‘Green Criminology’ Presidential Panel of the American Society of Criminology conference held in Atlanta, Georgia in November 2013. The first of these papers explored the origins and early development of green criminology as an identifiable paradigm or perspective. The second delved into the question of species justice and the challenges of such analysis for criminological considerations. The aim of this paper is to sketch out the future of green criminology, by focussing primarily upon the importance of engagement in research and action around issues pertaining to climate change. Before doing so, it is useful to briefly reconsider the key elements of green criminology as a form of intellectual intervention.</div>"
