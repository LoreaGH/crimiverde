abstract: "<div class=text-justify>This groundbreaking text provides an overview and assessment of green criminology as well as a call to action. Green Criminology draws attention to the ways in which the political-economic organization of capitalism causes ecological destruction and disorganization. Focusing on real-world issues of green crime and justice, chapters include political-economic examinations of ecological withdrawals, ecological additions, toxic towns, wildlife poaching and trafficking, environmental justice, environmental laws, and nongovernment environmental organizations. The book also presents an unintimidating introduction to research from the physical sciences on issues such as climate change, pollution levels, and the ecological footprint of humans, providing a truly interdisciplinary foundation for green criminological analysis. To help students succeed in the course-and to encourage them to see themselves as future green criminology researchers-end-of-chapter materials include: Questions and Activities for Students that review topics students should be able to conceptualize and address. Lessons for Researchers that provide ideas about additional research that might be worthwhile to undertake.</div>"
