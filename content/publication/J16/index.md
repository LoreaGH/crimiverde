abstract: "<div class=text-justify>The politics and conquests of the Global North have long necessitated the forced migration, colonization and ecological plunder of the Global South for imperial and capital expansionism. In recent decades, these excesses of accelerated industrialization have created new victims, with entire populations or climate refugees (Barnes and Dove 2015) or environmental refugees (Seelye 2001) dislocated by human-induced climate change. This article adopts Connellâ€™s (2007) southern theory and Carrington and colleagues (2015) idea of a southern criminology to examine critically the notion of climate apartheid and explore its impacts on the increasing number of individuals displaced by environmental harms.</div>"
